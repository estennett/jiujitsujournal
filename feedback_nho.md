## Project Workflow

**Exceeds Expecations**

Very impressed with your planning process! You easily scoped out and prepared for an MVP, and hit your checkpoints along the way.  Next time, I'd recommend writing out user stories for your gold version/ice-box features. Also, please include set-up instructions for this application in your `readme`, as well as technologies utilized.

## Technical Requirements

**Meets Expectations**

Nice job implementing user authentication, and user authentication! Good job on setting up your associations, I think we've identified the steps if you wanted to add more models/modify associations. Would to see you keep working on this to add some more features/external technologies.

## Creativity / Interface

**Meets Expectations**

Really like how you went out a built an app to solve a problem that's personal and applicable for you!  What are some of the next steps to build on this work? How could you implement a  `favorites` relationship for `entries` or `techniques`, or make the app more social for users? Overall, this app's design and interface really fit well with the purpose/functionality.
