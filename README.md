# The Jiujitsu Journal

The Jiujitsu Journal is an app designed to help Brazilian jiujtisu practitioners keep track of their training.  It has two main features: an Entry feature, and a Techniques feature.  The entry feature allows an individual to make logs of each training session detailing techniques covered, who taught the class, and any comments they had.  The Techniques feature allows the user to search through all of their techniques in all entries and has them displayed by catagory.

This was my second of four projects for my Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. This app was built using Ruby on Rails. I used PostgreSQL to persist my data, and used Bootstrap to style the site. 

The deployed site is hosted on Heroku here : [JiuJitsu Journal](https://www.google.com)
