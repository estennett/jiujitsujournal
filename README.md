# jiujitsujournal

The Jiujitsu Journal is an app to help a Brazilian jiujtisu practitioner keep track of his or her training.  It has two main features: an Entry feature, and a Techniques feature.  The entry feature will allow an individual to make logs of each training session detailing techniques covered, who taught the class, and any comments they had.  The Techniques feature allows the user to search through all of their techniques in all entries and has them displayed by catagory.
